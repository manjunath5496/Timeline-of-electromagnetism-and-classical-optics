<li>1600 &mdash;&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="William Gilbert (astronomer)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gilbert_(astronomer)">William Gilbert</a>&nbsp;publishes&nbsp;<em>De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure</em>&nbsp;("On the Magnet and Magnetic bodies, and on that Great Magnet the Earth"), Europe's then current standard on electricity and magnetism. He experimented with and noted the different character of electrical and magnetic forces. In addition to known ancient Greeks' observations of the electrical properties of rubbed amber, he experimented with a needle balanced on a pivot, and found that the needle was non-directionally affected by many materials such as alum, arsenic, hard resin,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Jet (lignite)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_(lignite)">jet</a>, glass, gum-mastic, mica, rock-salt, sealing wax, slags, sulfur, and precious stones such as amethyst,&nbsp;<a title="Beryl" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryl">beryl</a>, diamond, opal, and sapphire. He noted that electrical charge could be stored by covering the body with a non-conducting substance such as silk. He described the method of artificially magnetizing iron. His&nbsp;<a title="Terrella" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrella">terrella</a>&nbsp;(little earth), a sphere cut from a lodestone on a metal lathe, modeled the earth as a lodestone (magnetic iron ore) and demonstrated that every lodestone has fixed poles, and how to find them.&nbsp;He considered that gravity was a magnetic force and noted that this mutual force increased with the size or amount of lodestone and attracted iron objects. He experimented with such physical models in an attempt to explain problems in&nbsp;<a title="Navigation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation">navigation</a>&nbsp;due varying properties of the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Magnetic compass" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_compass">magnetic compass</a>&nbsp;with respect to their location on the earth, such as&nbsp;<a title="Magnetic declination" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_declination">magnetic declination</a>&nbsp;and magnetic inclination.

He and his student Andreas Cunaeus used a glass jar filled with water into which a brass rod had been placed. He charged the jar by touching a wire leading from the electrical machine with one hand while holding the outside of the jar with the other. The energy could be discharged by completing an external circuit between the brass rod and another conductor, originally his hand, placed in contact with the outside of the jar. He also found that if the jar were placed on a piece of metal on a table, a shock would be received by touching this piece of metal with one hand and touching the wire connected to the electrical machine with the other.</li>

He is credited with utilizing the concepts of positive and negative charge in the explanation of then known electrical phenomenon. He theorized that there was an electrical fluid (which he proposed could be the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Luminiferous ether" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_ether#The_history_of_light_and_aether">luminiferous ether</a>, which was used by others before and after him, to explain the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Wave theory of light" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_theory_of_light">wave theory of light</a>) that was part of all material and all intervening space. The charge of any object would be neutral if the concentration of this fluid were the same both inside and outside of the body, positive if the object contained an excess of this fluid, and negative if there were a deficit. In 1749 he had documented the similar properties of lightning and electricity, such as that both an&nbsp;<a title="Electric spark" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_spark">electric spark</a>&nbsp;and a lightning flash produced light and sound, could kill animals, cause fires, melt metal, destroy or reverse the polarity of magnetism, and flowed through conductors and could be concentrated at sharp points. He was later able to apply the property of concentrating at sharp points by his invention of the lightning rod, for which he intentionally did not profit. He also investigated the Leyden jar, proving that the charge was stored on the glass and not in the water, as others had assumed.</li>

He called this "animal electricity". Years of experimentation in the 1780s eventually led him to the construction of an arc of two different metals (copper and zinc for example) by connecting the two metal pieces and then connecting their open ends across the nerve of a frog leg, producing the same muscular contractions (by completing a circuit) as originally accidentally observed. The use of different metals to produce an electrical spark is the basis that led Alessandro Volta in 1799 to his invention of his voltaic pile, which eventually became the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Battery (electricity)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)">galvanic battery</a>.</li>
<li>1799 &mdash;&nbsp;<a title="Alessandro Volta" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Volta">Alessandro Volta</a>, following Galvani's discovery of galvanic electricity, creates a&nbsp;<a title="Voltaic pile" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaic_pile">voltaic cell</a>&nbsp;producing an electric current by the chemical action of several pairs of alternating copper (or silver) and zinc discs "piled" and separated by cloth or cardboard which had been soaked brine (salt water) or acid to increase conductivity. In&nbsp;<strong>1800</strong>&nbsp;he demonstrates the production of light from a glowing wire conducting electricity. This was followed in 1801 by his construction of the first&nbsp;<a title="Electric battery" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery">electric battery</a>, by utilizing multiple voltaic cells. Prior to his major discoveries, in a letter of praise to the Royal Society 1793, Volta reported Luigi Galvani's experiments of the 1780s as the "most beautiful and important discoveries", regarding them as the foundation of future discoveries. Volta's inventions led to revolutionary changes with this method of the production of inexpensive, controlled electric current vs. existing frictional machines and Leyden jars. The electric battery became standard equipment in every experimental laboratory and heralded an age of practical applications of electricity.<sup id="cite_ref-Clark_10-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_electromagnetism_and_classical_optics#cite_note-Clark-10">[10]</a></sup><sup class="noprint Inline-Template">[<em><a title="Wikipedia:Citing sources" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources"><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears.

<li>1831 &mdash;&nbsp;<a title="Michael Faraday" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday">Michael Faraday</a>&nbsp;began experiments leading to his discovery of the law of&nbsp;<a title="Electromagnetic induction" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction">electromagnetic induction</a>, though the discovery may have been anticipated by the work of Francesco Zantedeschi. His breakthrough came when he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around a massive iron ring, bolted to a chair, and found that upon passing a current through one coil, a momentary electric current was induced in the other coil. He then found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire, or vice versa, an electric current also flowed in the wire. He then used this principle to construct the&nbsp;<a title="Dynamo" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo">electric dynamo</a>, the first electric power generator. He proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the empty space around the conductor, but did not complete that work. Faraday's concept of lines of flux emanating from charged bodies and magnets provided a way to visualize electric and magnetic fields. That mental model was crucial to the successful development of electromechanical devices which were to dominate the 19th century. His demonstrations that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field, mathematically modeled by&nbsp;<a title="Faraday's law of induction" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction">Faraday's law of induction</a>, would subsequently become one of&nbsp;<a title="Maxwell's equations" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations">Maxwell's equations</a>.

Lenz's law is one consequence of the principle of&nbsp;<a title="Conservation of energy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy">conservation of energy</a>. If a magnet moves towards a closed loop, then the induced current in the loop creates a field that exerts a force opposing the motion of the magnet.
